# Functional Programming

<h3> These are some of the things I want to learn about functional programming </h3>

```
- Prototypal Inheritance
- Immutability
- First Class Functions
- Pure Functions
- Higher Order Functions
- Recursion
- Currying
- Partial Application
- Lambdas
```


<p> I'm going to tackle these the best I can. While most of the examples here will be in javascript for sheer simplicity, I will also some have examples in </p> 
<ul>
  <li>Elixir</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Elm</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p> I would eventually like to learn haskell and include some exportable code from that language in this repo. </p>
